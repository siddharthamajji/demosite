Curious to know the process behind how your favourite biscuit landed on your table? So, here’s how….. basically there are 3 things that we manage in a supply chain. The product, the Cash and the Information. But in order to get that biscuit, many stake holders with in the supply chain manage a set of complex activities. Lets’ go in detail about how the supply chain is playing a crucial role in biscuit manufacturing. Lets’s talk about the product first, the supplier of the biscuit procures the important raw materials like flour, butter and sugar from their respective suppliers. Then by using these raw materials, and after some processing, the biscuits are made. Once this is made, all the biscuits are made into batches, packed and dispatched from suppliers. Then it reached the distributor, then to the retailer and finally to the customer. Basically the product flow here is from left to right.

Now coming to the second part, the Cash. So, wondering how the producer of the biscuit is earning money? It is all the money of the customer. The money which you pay to the retailer or petty shop, for purchasing a biscuit packet, will go to the distributor and then finally reaches the producer or supplier. In this case the flow of cash is from right to left. This is the case with the return of the product as well.

So, in order to go this in a very smooth manner, the main factor, information should flow from one to other seamlessly. So, this is how the supply chain for the biscuit you eat is done.
